## **Hi there 👋**

I'm a Software Engineer based in Saint Petersburg, Russia with **3 years** of experience in the software industry. Able to self-manage effectively during independent projects, as well as collaborate as part of a production team. Like to work with various platforms, languages, and embedded systems.

- **Java** is "*native*" programming language, I've been working with it for **over 3 years**. I've used it in the back-end development with **Spring**, as well as for test automation using **Rest Assured** or more often using **TestNG** or **JUnit5** plus **Mockito**. Generally I worked with Java 8, but at the last job many projects migrated on Java 14. I must often use **Maven** although I'd say I'm in love with **Gradle**.
- **Python** is main scripting language for me. I've been worked with it **for 4 years**. I've mostly used Python at my last work position with **Flask** and **Jinja/React**.
- I've been worked with **JavaScript** **for 2 years**. I've used it in the front-end development with **Vue** and **React**. Of course, I also use HTML\CSS and very often Bootstrap. React is only used for work tasks, whereas **Vue** with **Vuex** and **Vue Router** for pet projects.

I readily take on new challenges and enthusiastically immerse myself in the process. I use a good code review as a tool for quick training with more “strong” colleagues. I like to use new interesting languages and technologies in work and in  my home projects. I work well in a team, I can compromise.

## **Working At**

- **Inango LTD.**

    At Inango I've had many opportunities to learn new concepts and technologies. Company's main product is a Service Orchestrator currently in POC status. Implementing every new feature must include HLD/TLD stages, to use the most suitable technology. My main responsibilities:

    - Reseraching activity
    - Writing HLD/TLD documentation
    - Implementing new features

    Most used technologies: **Java (Spring Boot, Spring Data, RMQ, gRPC, Netflix\*), PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Python (Flask, Pydantic, Jinja), HTML/CSS/JavaScript (React), Docker, ONOS, OvS, Go**
